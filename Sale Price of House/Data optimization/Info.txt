The process of studying(analysing) a variable in detail is called Univariate Analysis

Ouliers are data points distant from rest of the obsevations.

lower_limit = q1 - 1.5*iqr
upper_limit = q3 + 1.5*iqr
iqr= Inter-quatile range= q3-q1

Any data point which is higher than upper limit or lower than the lower limit can be termed as an outlier

(Since Matplotlib doesn't have the ability to ignore missing values we use the seaborn library as it can ignore
missing values)
# Treating this missing values(Reduces the performance of the model)
# Deleting the whole row having missing values
# Imputing the missing values by replacing them with the average values or mean values or mode values.
    Imputing is not advisable for treating missing values since the model we derive will be from the target variable
    but imputing the target variable the model will learn from the data we will be deriving rather than the actual
    data.

   Variable Transformation
   Variable transformation refers to the process of making changes to a variable in a away that it becomes more useful
   and meaningful for analysis and modelling purposes.
   1.Outlier Treatment
   2.When the variable does not represent the information in the best possible way.
   3.To derive a new variable from an existing variable or combining two variable to transform a variable so that it
     becomes more useful.
     eg:The column renovated year can be used to derive two new variables ever renovated and how long ago the renovation
        was done. This could also impact the target variable sale price

                                                    Corelations
   How close two variables are to have a linear relationship with each other. IT is a measure or dependence or association between
   two variables i.e. how does one variable change with change in other.

                                                   Conditional Variable
   1.What information does the variable contain?
   2.Do the few sample values that we are able to eyeball(i.e. skim through) make sense?
   3.How many and what unique values i.e. levels does the categorical variable have and what is the frequency distribution
   of those unique values?
   4.How is dependent/target variable correlated with this variable.

                                                   ANOVA
   Analysis of Variance
   It checks if the means i.e. average value of the target vaiable across different levels or uniques values of a categorical
   variable are equal or not.
